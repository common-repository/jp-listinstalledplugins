replace a selected page. Output fully templatable via XSLT.

Lists your currently installed and activated plugins. Plugins can be hidden form
the list if desired. Options page allows you to set a page to display the list
on, change the format, and configure other options. The plugin also features a
customizable widget to display your plugins. The plugin is multi-lingual ready
with much text already being translated using built in strings. To summarize;
this plugin features as many customizations as you could possibly want for
something seemingly so simple.

   to your worpress plugins directory: `/wp-content/plugins/`.

4. However if you want to use the templating or replacement options go to the
   LIP Options page under Plugins to configure required options.
5. Hide any plugins you don't want to show because of language, poor description
   or otherwise.

= What is XSL/XSLT? =

(Excerpt from w3schools)
XSL stands for EXtensible Stylesheet Language.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) started to develop XSL because there was a
need for an XML-based style sheet language.

XSLT stands for XSL Transformations.

To put it another way, XSL is an advanced templateing language.

Read more about XSLT at [w3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/xsl), or at
[w3](http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt).
